How it works:

1. Just open index.html in chrome browser the application should work. (Other browsers are not tested).
2. Slide the bar - accordingly text value should change star would change it's size and colour accordingly.
3. Enter value between -100 and 100 Star would change colour and slider would set to value entered in textbox.
4. To make point 3 work press 'tab' after entering value into Text box. (Need to exit text box)
5. No internet connection needed.



Info:

1. Developed with HTML CSS and Javascript ES 6.0.
2. No external libraries used hence no external dependencies.


Principal:
 
 The colour is visualised by our eyes as darker when opacity is increased.
Hence opacity and blurnes of filter layer is varied as per input. 


Bugs.

1. App is not designed to be responsive.
2. Error message after the wrong entry in text box is not cleared.
